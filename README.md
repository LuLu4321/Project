What is your actual project trying to display and solve?
    o	The purpose of the project is to let UMD students easily view the professors and meetings (days and times) of their desired course. They will also be able to see how many sections the professors are teaching and how many sections are offered within a time slot of lecture days. This way the students don’t have to spend extra time on Testudo trying to manually count all the professors or meetings. All they have to do is search for the information using the course name. They’ll have the results at a faster rate ready to be viewed for whatever decision they are trying to make using it.
